;; Main meta-module for the Lâ‚ƒ library, with run-time check enabled.
;; For more performance (but less safety), use lib-unsafe.ml3 instead.

;; NOTE: for now, this module behaves exactly like lib-unsafe, because
;; the halt primitive is still missing, and because requirements
;; haven't been added to the library yet.
